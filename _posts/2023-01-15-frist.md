title:  "Why do we study multiscale ABL?"
---

### The ABL is the atmospheric boundary layer, which is directly influneced by the Earth's surface. Previous studies on the ABL has focused on the horizontally homogeneous ABL in which turbulence only exists. But in reality, mesoscale circulations usually coexist with turbulence in the ABL. In other words, the spatiotemporal variation of the ABL is multiscale. Thus, we do study realistic, multiscale ABL.
